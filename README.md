# Checking the Password Strength using ML

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the strength of passwords using various machine learning algorithms. It's designed to help implement a robust defense mechanism against password breaches by ensuring the use of highly secure passwords.

## Objectives

- To facilitate the creation of strong passwords that enhance security
- To provide an easy-to-use tool to assess password strength
- To leverage machine learning for effective password strength classification

## Algorithms Used

This software employs a suite of machine learning algorithms, each contributing unique strengths to the task of password strength classification:

- **Decision Trees**: Utilizes a tree-like model for decision-making and classification.
- **Logistic Regression**: Applies a logistic model to categorize passwords into distinct strength levels.
- **Naive Bayes (Bernoulli Distribution Model)**: Employs Bayes' theorem with a naive independence assumption for feature classification.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that improves classification accuracy through multiple decision trees.
- **Neural Network (MLP Classifier)**: Uses a multilayer perceptron model to capture complex patterns and relationships in data.
